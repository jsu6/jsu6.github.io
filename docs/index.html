        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My research focuses on understanding and mitigating emerging threats to the security and privacy of the web, as well as developing innovative measurement techniques to assess the web. My primary objective is to comprehend the browser, which serves as the foundation for the web, followed by an in-depth analysis. I believe building automated tools is a reasonable and effective approach to achieve these goals.</p>
